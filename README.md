# Kubernetes Infrastructure Project

This project sets up essential infrastructure for a Kubernetes cluster. It includes:

- **Cert-Manager**: Automates the management and issuance of TLS certificates.
- **Cluster Issuer**: Provides cluster-wide certificate issuing capabilities.
- **EFK Stack**: Offers centralized logging with Elasticsearch, Fluent Bit, and Kibana.
- **Prometheus Stack**: Enables robust monitoring and alerting for the cluster.
- **Ingress Controller**: Manages external access to services within the cluster.
